| **Routing**             | Direct matching within or between pools                         | Sophisticated routing with multiple paths for optimal rates        |
| **Efficiency**          | Fast execution; may not always provide optimal rates            | Improved efficiency with better trading rates through optimization |
| **Liquidity Provision** | 50/50 ratio token pairs; straightforward addition/removal       | Complex arrangements; support for multiple AMMs and protocols      |
| **Incentives**          | Fees from trades within pools                                   | Aggregated fees and potentially higher returns                     |
| **Security**            | Extensive testing and audits; proven track record               | Rigorous audits; advanced security measures                        |
| **User Experience**     | Simple, user-friendly interface                                 | Enhanced features; advanced routing and multi-chain support        |
