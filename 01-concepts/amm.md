# AMM

#### What is an AMM?

An [**Automated Market Maker (AMM)**](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/encyclopedia/sdex/liquidity-on-stellar-sdex-liquidity-pools#automated-market-makers-amms) is a decentralized protocol that facilitates asset exchanges without relying on a traditional order book. Instead of using buy and sell orders, [AMMs ](https://stellar.org/blog/developers/introducing-automated-market-makers-on-stellar?locale=en)employ mathematical formulas to determine asset prices based on the relative quantities within their liquidity pools.

Soroswap.Finance operates as an AMM with its own [liquidity pools](https://docs.soroswap.finance/01-concepts/02-pools), distinct from other AMMs like Stellar Classic DEX or Phoenix. Soroswap.Finance ensures that asset swaps are managed autonomously and efficiently, maintaining liquidity and price stability through its decentralized framework.
