## Step 2: Select the tokens for the swap

1. In the top section, select the token you want to sell.

## Step 5: Trustlines

When you swap a token for the first time on Soroswap.Finance, you'll need to sign a "trustline" transaction.
Trustlines are an explicit authorization that allows your account to hold and exchange a specific asset.


## Step 6: Confirm the transaction

1. Your Freighter wallet will open, displaying the transaction details.
2. Review the transaction information and click "Approve" to confirm the swap.
3. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain.

2. You can also view the transaction details with the transaction hash or by clicking "View on explorer".
