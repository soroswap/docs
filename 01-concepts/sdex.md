# SDEX

What is Stellar SDEX, what is the difference with Soroswap.Finance and why it is not aggregated by the Soroswap Aggregator

### What is Stellar SDEX?

[**Stellar SDEX**](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/encyclopedia/sdex) **(Stellar Decentralized Exchange)** is the native decentralized exchange of the Stellar network. It allows users to trade assets directly on the Stellar blockchain through a system of order books. Hereâ€™s how it operates:

* **Order Books:** Stellar SDEX uses order books to facilitate trades. Users place buy and sell offers in the order book, which are matched based on price and time priority.
* **Order Types:** Users can create various types of orders, such as market or limit orders. Orders are automatically matched against existing orders in the book.
* **Asset Exchange:** Trades are executed by matching buy and sell orders within the order books. Assets are exchanged directly between users without needing an intermediary.
* **Path Payments:** If there is no direct order for an asset pair, Stellar allows path payments to find the best route through multiple assets to complete the trade.
