# Connecting Your Wallet to Stellar Blockchain

Connecting your wallet to the Stellar blockchain is a crucial step for interacting securely and efficiently with the network. Whether you're working in the production environment (Mainnet) or a test environment (Testnet), establishing this connection allows you to perform transactions, manage assets, and engage with decentralized applications (dApps) on Stellar. Below is a guide to help you connect your wallet to the Stellar blockchain:

### &#x20;[**Choosing the Network**](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/fundamentals/networks)**: Mainnet vs. Testnet**

* **Mainnet:** This is the live, production environment where transactions are real and have financial value. Connecting to the Mainnet is necessary when you intend to interact with actual assets and perform legitimate transactions. The passphrase for Mainnet is `Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015`.
* **Testnet:** A free and secure environment for testing and development, where transactions don't involve real money. It's ideal for experimenting and validating applications before launching them on Mainnet. Passphrase: `Test SDF Network ; December 2014`.\

### **Configuring Your Wallet**

Once you've selected the appropriate network, you'll need to configure your wallet accordingly:

* **Select Network:** Most wallets offer a simple option to switch between Mainnet and Testnet. Ensure you're on the correct network for your intended use.
* **Enter the Network Passphrase:** When prompted, input [the network passphrase](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/networks) to ensure your wallet connects to the correct blockchain environment.
* **Custom Node Configuration (Optional):** If you're using a custom [Horizon node ](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/data/horizon/horizon-providers#ecosystem-horizon-providers)or need to connect to a specific node provider like ANKR, configure the Horizon URL in your wallet settings.
