# Supported AMMs

Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are essential to decentralized finance (DeFi), enabling the efficient exchange of assets without centralized intermediaries or traditional order books. The Stellar network supports several AMMs that each offer unique features to improve liquidity and decentralized trading. Below is an overview of key AMMs supported by Soroswap Finance:

* [**Soroswap AMM**](https://soroswap.finance)\
  Soroswap.Finance is a decentralized AMM on Stellar, providing users with seamless asset swaps through liquidity pools. The platform employs algorithms that automatically adjust asset prices based on the pool's asset ratios, ensuring liquidity and price stability. Soroswap is tailored to the Stellar ecosystem and focuses on user-friendly, efficient swaps, making it a preferred choice for decentralized trading.
* [**Phoenix AMM**](https://github.com/Phoenix-Protocol-Group/docs/blob/main/Initial%20Phoenix%20Whitepaper.pdf)\
  The Phoenix AMM is part of the Phoenix Protocol ecosystem, a suite of decentralized applications on Stellar. It integrates with the Phoenix DEX and other DeFi services, ensuring that liquidity is provided autonomously through smart contracts. Phoenix AMM's primary goal is to enhance the Stellar ecosystem by offering decentralized, efficient trading across its applications.
* [**Aquarius AMM**](https://aqua.network) **(Coming Soon)**\
  Aquarius incentivizes liquidity provision and market-making on the Stellar network. The AQUA token community votes to determine which markets receive liquidity incentives, and top-voted markets reward Stellar DEX market makers and AMM liquidity providers. As Aquarius AMMs evolve, rewards will gradually shift from Stellar AMMs to Aquarius-specific AMMs, bringing more control and governance into the hands of the community.
