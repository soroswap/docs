# Provide Liquidity

Providing liquidity on **Soroswap** allows users to earn rewards by depositing two assets into a liquidity pool. Liquidity providers (LPs) facilitate asset swaps for other users, and in return, they earn a share of the trading fees collected by the protocol.

### &#x20;How to Provide Liquidity

1. **Access the app**\
   Go to [soroswap.finance](https://soroswap.finance/) and click **Launch App**.
2. **Connect your wallet**\
   Use a Stellar/Soroban-compatible wallet. Make sure you have enough XLM for transaction fees.
3. **Navigate to the Liquidity section**\
   In the app, select **Liquidity** to view existing pools

4. **Deposit both assets**

* Enter the amounts of each asset you want to deposit.
* The ratio must match the current pool price (or, when creating a new pool, you set the initial price).

5. **Receive pool tokens**\
   After a successful deposit, you’ll receive pool tokens that represent your share of the pool’s liquidity.

### Key Notes

* **Initial liquidity providers** set the initial price of a new pool.
* **All liquidity pools follow the formula**: `x * y = k`, where `k` is constant.
* **Removing liquidity**: You can withdraw your assets at any time by burning your pool tokens, receiving your share of the assets plus accumulated fees.
