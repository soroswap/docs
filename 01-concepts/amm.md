# AMM

#### What is an AMM?

An [**Automated Market Maker (AMM)**](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/encyclopedia/sdex/liquidity-on-stellar-sdex-liquidity-pools#automated-market-makers-amms) is a decentralized protocol that facilitates asset exchanges without relying on a traditional order book. Instead of using buy and sell orders, AMMs employ mathematical formulas to determine asset prices based on the relative quantities within their liquidity pools.

Soroswap.Finance operates as an AMM with its own [liquidity pools](https://docs.soroswap.finance/01-concepts/02-pools), distinct from other AMMs like Stellar Classic DEX or Phoenix. By utilizing a proprietary model, Soroswap.Finance ensures that asset swaps are managed autonomously and efficiently, maintaining liquidity and price stability through its decentralized framework.
