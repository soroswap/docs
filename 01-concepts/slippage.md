# Slippage

**Slippage** is the difference between the expected price of a swap and the actual price at the time of execution. It often occurs due to rapid changes in liquidity or asset demand.

In Soroswap, you can set your slippage tolerance directly from the swap settings menu.

#### What does it mean?

> If the price changes more than the allowed slippage percentage during execution, **the transaction will automatically revert** to protect you from an unfavorable trade.

#### Available options:

* **Auto**: The system automatically selects an appropriate slippage based on current pool liquidity.
* **Custom**: Set your own value (e.g., 1%).

> ðŸ›  You can find this setting by clicking the **gear icon** in the upper corner of the swap interface.
